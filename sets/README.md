In the attached file namespl.txt there is a list of names, each on a new line. The problem is that the names are repeated, and in our program we will only need unique names. Additionally, we would like the names to be automatically sorted in reverse alphabetical order (actually almost alphabetical, since we take into account the Unicode codes of the given characters).

After selecting the appropriate data set, display on the screen the number of unique names, as well as the first and last element of the set
