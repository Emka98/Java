...Write a program whose task is to sort numbers in an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. Its operation is clearly explained on Wikipedia, so we will not duplicate someone else's work and encourage you to read it - http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortowanie_b%C4%85belkowe

To sort the array, use an anonymous class that implements a custom interface Sortable with a sort() method that takes an array of numbers as a parameter.

The array can be hard-coded in the program.
